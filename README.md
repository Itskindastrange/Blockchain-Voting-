Blockchain Voting System
This repository contains a simple implementation of a blockchain-based voting system in Go (Golang). The system allows voters to register, cast votes for candidates, prevents double voting, and calculates election results based on the votes cast.

Features
Blockchain Implementation: Utilizes a blockchain data structure to store the history of votes cast.
Voter Registration: Allows voters to register before casting their votes.
Vote Casting: Registered voters can cast their votes for available candidates.
Double Voting Prevention: Ensures that voters cannot cast more than one vote in the same election.
Election Result Calculation: Calculates and displays the winner of the election or identifies ties.
Components
Main Go Program: Contains the core logic for registering voters, casting votes, calculating hashes, and determining election results.
Blockchain Structure: Defines the structure of blocks in the blockchain and how votes are stored within them.
Voter Registration and Double Voting Check: Handles voter registration and prevents double voting.
Election Result Calculation: Logic for calculating and displaying the winner of the election.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Go installed.
Run the main program (main.go) to simulate the voting process and calculate election results.
